# Answers to Programming: Principles and Practice Using C++

Here are my solutions for Programming: Principles and Practice Using C++ 
exercises. I worked on these as a way to learn C++ without having to think of a 
project to build. I would probably not write code this way anymore

## Building the Code

Building the solutions here requires you to create a `GUI/` folder at the root 
of this project. Compile all of the code from [Bjarne's GitHub][1] for your system, and 
place the objects and headers in this folder. Then you should simply be able to 
run `make` or `./build.sh` in the answer folders.
